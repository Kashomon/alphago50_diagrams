K   	AlphaGo’s self-play matches. You see, doesn’t it look familiar that White begins the game with a 3-3 invasion? (Diagram 1)
L   	Yeah! I recall this position from AlphaGo’s first game against Ke Jie.
S   	Oh! Of course, I watched that game live as well. It was 7 PM in California…I even streamed this game to English-speaking viewers on my own channel.
L   	Most people know the standard joseki that follows a 3-3 invasion. Even it was previously asserted to be inferior for the invading side, AlphaGo has really challenged that assertion by playing direct 3-3’s.
K   	Especially when there is wide open space on both sides of the star-point stone.
S   	Goodness…So 3-3 right off the bat?
K   	Since Move 6 in this game, it appears.
L   	I once read an article by Li Zhe 6p; he argued that the 3-3 and 4-4 point acted as weaknesses of each other. It kind of makes sense, doesn’t it? A 3-3 can take away territory, but can also be flattened by a 4-4.
S   	Is that so? I mean, there surely isn’t one perfect move for the corner.
K   	But if there are weaknesses, why does AlphaGo still play at the star-point?
L   	There certainly is a reason for that. Maybe AlphaGo thinks that this joseki is normal?]

S   	Alright, Black blocking the larger side. We’ve seen 7-12 in previous AlphaGo games…Yet somehow Black invades again at 13?! (Diagram 2)
K   	Yep! Well, this is surprising for me too. Feels almost like a counterpunch from Black.

S   	Still, two 3-3’s in the opening is already mad impressive.
K   	(laughs) But…Wait for it…There’s one more 3-3 invasion at White’s Move 42! (Diagram 3)
L   	So three 3-3’s in one game!
K   	If the bottom left corner had a star-point stone, this could’ve been a game with 3-3’s in all four corners. We haven’t really witnessed anything like that; it would be bananas, though!
S   	Can’t wait to see the following games, honestly. When we were taught the 3-3 joseki, that hane exchange was much “necessary,” although it would give Black tremendous thickness.
L   	If one of my students played a move like White 42, it would surely drive me nuts! Black would get a wall after blocking, with the extra stone on the right side. I would tell them to approach the corner…I guess I can’t harangue anymore, ha-ha.]

S   	So whenever they play a bad move from now on, you’ll think of AlphaGo moves? (laughs)
L   	Maybe I just haven’t reached that level yet. I’ll probably say, “hey, you just played like AlphaGo right there! I have no idea if it’s good, though!”
K   	In the game, Black chooses to kill White with force, and both sides start an intense fight. By Move 206, White’s dragon still hasn’t lived with two eyes, but Black hasn’t quite settled yet either… (Diagram 4)
L   	Now that’s what I call a hundred-point jumbo capturing race!]

K   	After this, if Black 1 insisted to kill White, as we can see, he would not have two eyes after White 8, and the semeai would seem advantageous for White. (Variation 3)
S   	So Black resigns after 206?
K   	Yeah.
L   	I would probably fall asleep counting all the liberties in this semeai…It’s too complicated! I heard that AlphaGo only thinks about the situation for 2 minutes. Even Master Kang wouldn’t be good enough to top that!]

K   	Both sides could have also chosen the joseki which appeared in the 1st AlphaGo vs. Ke Jie game. Black hane’s, White blocks, creating an opportunity for Black to double hane on the outside. This sequence from 1-9 has been observed as the new 3-3 joseki. (Variation 2)
S   	Black has a stone in the bottom left to serve as ladder breaker, correct?
K   	Right, so Black can consider this option. In the game, however, Black probably is concerned about White threatening ladder breakers.]

L   	In fact, the top right shape evolved from the original joseki, in which White would hane on the second line after Black’s extension at 5. AlphaGo, however, would always save that exchange and split on the side, using the sente to take a large move! (Variation 1)
S   	I remember that before AlphaGo, that hane exchange would appear almost automatic to anyone.]
