(;W[qk]C[[DIAGRAM 1: 47-56\]

K	I’m more amazed by how White invades Black’s right side. You see, by Move 55, Black has a huge moyo framework on the right side. White’s Move 56, though… (Diagram 1)
S	Wait, this is a Misclick, right?! Did you download the wrong game file?
K	Nope, nope, nope. That’s really Move 56. Right there.
L	What the…This…this doesn’t work, right? One surely can’t put himself up against the opponent’s strength!]

K	So Black defiantly blocks at 57. White, somehow, allows Black to hane on top at 59, and calmly hane’s on the second line at 60! I’m just speechless… (Diagram 2)]

K	There’s a proverb that states, “never allow your opponent to hane on top, when you only have two stones.” In the game, however…I can’t believe how Black tenuki’s to the left side! (Diagram 3)]

S	So it’s best to preserve the aji when a position is unclear?
K	Possibly. In the game…After several exchanges, White gives up the stones on the right side, but grabs a precious corner! After both sides complete a trade at 80 and 81, White has gained a lot of points in addition to earning sente. (Diagram 4)
L	And Black’s corner is gone…just like that?
K	After having sacrificed a few stones, of course. This is a fancy-looking trade, though!
S	Only shaved ice can come to our rescue now.]

K	If White didn’t attach at Move 66, living locally with shape would also be an okay option. (Variation 5) But Move 66 feels even more aggressive, intending to grab cash from Black’s bottom-right corner!
L	Even if White doesn’t live immediately, a lot of aji still exists in the area. Saving this aji is also a good probing technique.

S	Err…Normally Black would hane first and peep after White extends, to deliver a coherent attack. (Variation 3)
K	Yeah, but AlphaGo just tenuki’s regardless of what we think.

;W[qn]C[[VARIATION 4\]

K	I understand a lot more after seeing White’s second-line attachment at Move 66. This move looks very strange, but it does help White live comfortably. Black’s attacks look relentless, but hasn’t received a lot of profit. For instance, if Black hane’s from the outside, White would just live a simple life on the side. (Variation 4)
L	I don’t think we can evaluate Alpha-sensei’s moves with solely human standards.
S	If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to come up with this variation! I mean, there should be some sort of reason for AlphaGo to play like this, but I wouldn’t dare trying this out in a human game.]

S	I think maybe one space below? For example, if Black kicks, White would be able to jump out with very light play. That would seem like a reasonable invasion to me. (Variation 1)
K	I checked the kifu again, there weren’t any misplacements. AlphaGo is double-digit kyu confirmed!
L	Ha-ha, that’s insane! I would surely criticize my students for playing that move. They would probably tell me: sensei, I just wasn’t thinking.]

S	From what I remember, this isn’t completely unseen of, especially in san-ren-sei openings. White can choose to settle this way when appropriate. (Variation 2)
L	I’ve seen this sequence before. It still gives Black a lot of outside potential, though!]
