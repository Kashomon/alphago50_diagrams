S   	So I’m looking at the opening now; normally after the attachment joseki in the top left corner, Black would immediately extend three spaces according to convention. As the Go proverb says, one must extend one more space than the number of stones on their wall. In the game, however, Black plays a five-space extension…? (Diagram 1)
K   	Well, rest in peace, Go proverbs.
L   	So two-stone walls go with five-space extensions…Three with six then? (laughs)
S   	What’s wrong with extending three spaces though?]

K   	At this moment, invading might invite attacking moves from Black. Thus, if White invades the left side immediately, it’ll do nothing but help Black build territory.
S   	I see. AlphaGo probably has some regard for the thickness of Black’s three stones in the top left?
K   	Indeed. Alternatively, Black may think that there isn’t a way to completely solidify the left side with one move; and when there isn’t a perfect move, one may tenuki.
L   	…Otherwise it would defeat the point of the five-space extension!
S   	So White 12 encloses the bottom right, huh…Such calmness. (Diagram 2)
L   	Is that a shoulder hit I see at Move 13? Feels so AlphaGo-esque, ha-ha!
S   	Wait, fried scallions? (a pun in Chinese crafted by the author; the words “shoulder hit” and “fried scallions” sound similar.)
L   	I’m talking about shoulder hits!! This is the type of move I enjoy seeing the most from my students’ games. (laughs)
K   	So if I want to be your student, all I have to do is shoulder hit?
L   	Exactly. What do you guys think of it, though?
S   	I think that this move has prevented White from expanding easily, since White cannot spread to the bottom side with one move. Even if White wants to kill the shoulder-hitting stone, it would take a few moves’ effort.
K   	I don’t really get Black’s knight’s move at 15, though…]
;W[qf]
;B[mo]C[[DIAGRAM 3: 16-17\]

S   	White responds by approaching Black’s corner at Move 16, and Black extends at 17. What a tough answer by both sides, punching all over the place…I mean, I thought I was going to meet up with my friends and play Go, but now I feel that I know absolutely nothing about Go. (Diagram 3)
L   	If AlphaGo were a human, I would imagine it to be a stubborn child with lots of character! It always plays where we don’t think works.
K   	Yeah…I would have probably haned against Black’s shoulder-hitting stone.]

S   	Now that Black has extended, it’s time for White to invade the bottom left?
K   	I think so! Otherwise it would just become an iron bastion.
S   	So what does White do in the actual game?
K   	White 18 invades at 6-3, understandably; after Black pincers at 19, White 20 somehow decides to make sabaki with a knight’s move. (Diagram 4)]

K   	Exactly. Hahaha! …So as it turns out, Black’s Move 15 may be part of a greater plan. In a latter part of the game, Black and White cross-cut in the lower right; after Black’s attachment at 43, we normally hane back, right? (Diagram 5)
S   	Yeah, almost a first instinct. Even a calmer person would consider extending?]

K   	Now the flames of battle spread to the right side of the goban. When Black kicks at 63, White would normally like to follow up with a two-space or three-space extension to settle his stones. In the game, White tenuki’s again at Move 66! (Diagram 6)]

S   	This move can be ignored? I’ve heard strong players say that “two rivaling groups running is better than one,” as one lonely weak group would be depressing. Move 66, from what I see, also weakens Black’s shape; otherwise, if White plays a two-space extension, Black would have a chance to settle? (Variation 5)
K   	Sounds reasonable. AlphaGo has such a great sense of both thickness and profit, it knows what to get first.]
))(;W[il]
;B[ro]C[[VARIATION 4\]

K   	Agreed, a move seems rather necessary here. (in a suddenly stern voice) Black capturing White’s two stones in the bottom right is also valuable, however. It doesn’t really come to our minds like that, because we are so accustomed to our experience and sometimes ignore the true value of a move. Perhaps AlphaGo will change all that! (Variation 4)]

S   	My first thought would be jumping out and trying to make good shape after Black encloses the corner. Black would manage to reinforce both sides, however? (Variation 3)]
))(;B[mn]C[[VARIATION 2\]

L   	Err…I thought the shoulder hit intended to build a framework for the left side, so jumping out would be a good follow-up? (Variation 2)
K   	Maybe AlphaGo values the right side more than the left! I mean, I also think the left is huge, but…
S   	The left side certain feels huge, given the double wing formation.
K   	That’s our habitual thinking again, ha-ha. Double wing does sound fantastic, doesn’t it?
S   	The problem is, White can still invade despite Black’s wide extensions.]

K   	My prediction is, White would approach the bottom left corner and counter-pincer after Black’s pincer. It appears that Black’s stones are rather concentrated on the left side, and White has much faster pace. (Variation 1)
L   	Same for me; if I were Black, I wouldn’t want to see White all over the bottom and right sides.]
