L   	Err…So a large capture it is.
K   	Certainly so! (laughs) If you look at Moves 12-18, White is really trying to devour those two Black stones! (Diagram 1)
S   	Such a large capture…Almost comical to me.
K   	Who on earth even engulfs a corner like that? With just five stones?
L   	That’s insane. What a battle!
K   	So…That says a lot about whether we’re going to a restaurant or a stall. (looks at Stephen, grins)
S   	Great, looking forward to that. Don’t you think that 11 and 13 resemble the two of us sitting in a restaurant, and the large glass door consists of surrounding White stones? Move 19 looks a bit like Keng-ping, staring at us from outside.
L   	Just watching people eat in? Ha-ha.
S   	What does Move 19 signify, though?
K   	I can’t say I’m certain. It carries a lot of style points, first of all. It represents Go from the future, surely! I couldn’t come up with that myself.]

S	White’s Move 20 feels like a ferocious attacking move!
K	Indeed. Black, however, has dodged the aggression with knight’s moves at 21 and 23. Elegant as a ballet dancer! (Diagram 2)
L	We are watching a Go game, right? This is not chess?
K	Ha-ha, looks as if Black were programmed to only play knight’s moves.]

S	Yep. Black earns sente, though, which he employs to make territory with Move 35. Time for White to invade, maybe?
K	Mhmm. Black could have chosen to make unconditional life in the corner, but AlphaGo probably deems the outside stones more important.
L	Hold on…Are those five or six knight’s shapes I’ve seen?
K	Ha-ha! There’ve been several, I can tell you that.
S	Alright, let’s just go find somewhere to fill our bellies, shall we?
L	Oh yeah! There must be something tasty on Nanjing West Road.
K	This probably looks nice. Let’s wait in line for a bit…Oh, what move were we on? I forgot while I was parsing through the signboards.
S	We should probably go back to the game. Looks like White has adopted the knight’s move strategy as well, with Moves 40 and 42. Move 44…Wait, this is an elephant’s eye, right? Why doesn’t Black poke through? (Diagram 3)]

(;B[mm]C[[DIAGRAM 4: 45-47\]

K	I believe that White has other shenanigans; just like Move 22 in Game 4, which leaves a deliberate “weakness” to tempt the opponent. Black 45 and 47 though, oh my…I pray to the Gods of Sente for this one. (Diagram 4)
L	It certainly produces a cool visual effect. Flight of the Bumble-bumps, eh?
K	I really dig the name.]

K	If Black chose to block and cut White the traditional way, instead of bumping, White could exploit Black’s shortage of liberties and seal him in, after sacrificing two stones. Black would suffer from low efficiency this way. (Variation 5)
L	That’s such a breathtaking sequence. Truly amazing!]

S	I don’t think White could block at Move 22. Black would live with ease, and White wouldn’t have gotten much from this sequence. (Variation 3)

K	Yeah. Black could also decide to secure a simple life in the corner, but White can use the sente power and win big on the outside. If Black’s 17 gets attacked, the outlook might not look so bright. (Variation 2)]

S   	I thought that Black would jump out and initiate a running battle with White? (Variation 1)
L   	That would be the ordinary approach. What if Black actually wants to grab profit first from the outside and build the bottom framework, while saving aji for life on the left?]
