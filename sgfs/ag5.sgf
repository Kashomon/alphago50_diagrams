S   	This game feels somewhat similar to Game 4, in the way Black disobeys that proverb…So, six-space extensions for two-stone walls now, huh? (Diagram 1)
K   	Completely right! Maybe this is supposed to be an even fancier display of skills from AlphaGo? “I can handle five, now let me try six, eh?”
S   	Maybe seven in the future, too.
K   	Well, I’m quitting Go if I see seven. (laughs) I mean, a seven-space extension? That’s not even an extension anymore, it’s just a gap!]

K   	So the former affects Black’s shape on the left, producing a greater impact on the opponent than the latter does. You see, Black’s position on the left side is immediately weakened when White pincers at Move 24. (Diagram 2)
L   	(wakes up)…Ehhh?
K   	Oh hey, it’s Keng-ping!
L   	Um…yeah. We really woke up too early to go to the airport…
S   	So Kang-ting and I have decided to invite you to host our lunch.
L   	Wait, what?!
K   	I think it’s a great idea.
L   	I may have to file for bankruptcy by the time we finish talking about all 50 games…]

S   	Black tenuki’s again with Move 25, however. Is this a vital point?
K   	Yes, reinforcing Black and reducing White. Now that Black hasn’t answered the threat, White will surely attack the two Black stones at Move 26.
S   	So that’s how you do it. Hey, I learned something today!
K   	Right, because the bottom side is wider. When attacking, one should chase the opponent into taking a narrower path.
L   	But Black just continues to tenuki at Move 27, so both sides are just minding their own business? It certainly feels like a powerful move. (Diagram 3)]

K   	We’ve seen this peep in human games before. If White blocks, Black would hane first, connect, and then pierce through White’s shape! In that case, White would find it difficult to regroup. (Variation 3)]

;B[qj]C[[VARIATION 4\]

S   	What if White blocks from outside? Maybe Black can still hane first.
K   	You are correct, Black can still connect from the third line and leave White with a tricky situation, as White cannot kill the cutting stone. (Variation 4)
L   	Perhaps AlphaGo thinks there isn’t a perfect way of fixing this shape.]

L   	Heh…
S   	So Black will have to settle on the left side now?
K   	Yeah. A common approach would be to jump and look for better shape with a knight’s move. (Variation 2)]

;W[qf]C[[VARIATION 1\]

S   	On the left side…After White kicks at 18 and jumps at 20, Black doesn’t even extend on the left?
K   	Normally we would consider extending three spaces, of course. (Variation 1)]
