K   	I wasn’t joking…After Black kicks at 15, White plays the direct 3-3 invasion at 16. White then ventures deep into Black’s right side territory, but doesn’t seem to gain many points…For me, I wouldn’t play like this in a normal game. (Diagram 1)]

L   	I think this would be playable for both sides. In the game, however, White makes one eye on the right side. Still not enough to live!
K   	Which explains why Black can attack heavily in the following moves. When White plays the knight’s move at 42, Black’s cap at 43 feels breathtakingly powerful. (Diagram 2)
L   	Floating in the sky, huh?
K   	White jumps out at 44, but Black never ceases to disappoint with peeps at 49 and 51!
L   	This is almost too good…Two crucial shape points that hit White hard. That’s why I said White had weaknesses earlier.]

K   	I actually want to see how the game progresses. (plays out the moves) Aaaah, all the White stones are dead…?
L   	Err…Has White just abandoned all that stuff in the top right? (Diagram 3)
K   	I still think that there must be some reason behind AlphaGo’s moves. Honestly, though, it would be difficult for us humans to sacrifice such a large group.
L   	Yeah, looks like a lot of points.
K   	(yawns) I’m so exhausted…It’s been a long day today.

L   	So what happens at the end of this game?
K   	There comes a ko fight, (Diagram 4), and White manages to win with all the ko threats from his dead stones! Even though Black has captured a 29-stone dragon, White also manages to kill Black’s top left corner with the ko. What an aggressive game!
L   	This reminds me of Luo Xihe 9p’s masterpiece against Choi Cheolhan 9p in 2005! He sacrificed so many stones and yet won that game…Go is just amazingly complicated!]

L   	Bon travail, sir. Let me see what happens next in this game!
K   	Okay. One of the moves that stands out to me is White’s nose hit later in the game; as a tesuji, it creates so much aji in the area. (Variation 4)
L   	Whoa! What if Black blocks?
K   	Well, after exchanges 2-4, White would be enabled an A-B-C sequence to stir things up. Therefore, it’s not straightforward for Black to clear the bad aji here.
L   	Sounds like my old sneakers…
K   	Hahaha! Nice one.]

K   	What if White directly extended?
L   	Black would still be able to cap White after two sente exchanges on the left. White would be still heavy… (Variation 3)]
))(;W[nd]
;B[jd]C[[VARIATION 1\]

L   	First move that comes to mind after the kick should be the extension, right? But Black 2 would then be killing two birds with one stone: expanding on the top side, and attacking White’s stones. I’ve told my kids that this is supposedly good for Black. (Variation 1)]

K   	White can also choose to jump on top, but Black would have a natural tiger’s mouth of enormous value. If White then kicks Black in the top left corner, a battle would ensue… (Variation 2)]
