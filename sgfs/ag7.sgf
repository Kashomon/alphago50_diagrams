K	I said that because, White’s moves in the fuseki already contain thought for the follow-ups. Black plays a rare one-space high enclosure in Game 7, and White bumps Black right in the nose with Move 10! (Diagram 1)]

K	So Black extends at Move 11, to minimize White’s follow-up. White continues to bump, however; after White 16, we can clearly see that White’s Move 10 and Black’s Move 11 appear to be a very good exchange for White. (Diagram 2)
L	Mhmm. One of my most recommended methods I teach my students is the tewari analysis: swapping move orders, to determine whether a position is beneficial. Variation 1, which we just mentioned, can be alternatively regarded as the equivalent of 12-13-14-15-10-11. The first two exchanges feel normal to me; however, when White attaches at 10, extending at Move 11 is clearly a too-conservative choice.
S	So we might see more bumps in future human games?
K	What happens next in this game is truly legendary. First, Black…
L	Let me take a guess…3-3?]

K	Ha-ha, right on! Looks like we’ve found AlphaGo’s favorite fuseki pattern.
L	We are all familiar with this AlphaGo-style 3-3 joseki as well.
K	Yep. I’m sure White’s hane’s at 24 and 26 appear more familiar to you now. There’s a tiny difference though: when Black atari’s at 27, White just takes Black’s stone at 25 with Move 28. (Diagram 3)]CR[np]

S	I don’t think I’ve ever seen this joseki before…? So Black atari’s at 29, and this sequence ends with White laddering that Black stone at 34. Wait, does it work?
L	OMG…It does! Barely, but the ladder does work in favor of White, thanks to that bumping stone at Move 10! (Variation 2)
K	This must be the Great Prophecy from the God of Go!
S	That’s scary, I must admit. Taking ladders into account 20 moves in advance.
L	At least we can do something humans are good at. Bon appetit! ]

L	Does this bump even work? I mean, I never thought about it before.
S	Reminds me of Game 1! Bumps, attachments…however you name it, they seem to be one of AlphaGo’s favorite tricks.
K	Doesn’t matter what shape the opponent’s enclosure is, either. One can always create some aji.
S	In this situation, if Black plays a hane from the third line, White could continue to hane and force Black to connect inside…Now this would really resemble Game 1. (Variation 1) ]
