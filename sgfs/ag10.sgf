S	Mhmm. Kobayashi openings are quite popular, too, especially among amateur players. I remember that when I was playing in the 2015 US Go Open in Minnesota, I encountered 3 Kobayashi’s out of 6! They just seemed to slam down Moves 3-7 immediately, as if it were natural to them.
K	Both sides follow an unconventional path, however. White approaches one-space high at 8, and somehow Black elects to play a rare two-space low pincer at 9! (Diagram 1)
S	Err…This is a definite no-no for Go teachers, ha! Don’t we always recommend two-space approaches in response to the Kobayashi?
L	Yep, because Black has solid shape on the bottom side. Normally, we think that close approaches invite severe attacks, hence two-space moves are preferred.
S	The one-space high approach does exist though, right? Black is likely to play a two-space pincer next.]

L	I am a man with deep thoughts indeed. (giggles)
K	Littlelin retelling his own Kobayashi opening, ladies and gentlemen.
S	That pun sounds so out of place, ha-ha…
K	So White realizes that playing this knight’s move might invite Black to cut. In the game, White makes another knight’s move exchange at 10, and then plays the aforementioned move at 12. Such beautiful motion! (Diagram 2)
S	Indeed. It helps fix that cutting point, doesn’t it?]

L	I don’t think this result is bad for Black, though. He’s got both the corner and right side taken care of, no? For example, in the game, Black extends at 11; even though White can press Black with moves like 12-16, Black still saves up a decent amount of territory. In other words, can this be a new joseki? Like, the two-space low pincer, which we deemed as bad, might be in fact considerable? (Diagram 3)
K	It’s possible, certainly! I’ve never heard a lot of teachers mention this pincer, but now we have discovered so much more with AlphaGo!!]

L	My teacher used to tell me that two-space low pincers were not very welcome, because White could play a knight’s move. If Black attaches next, White would simply hane and connect, which would leave Black’s pincer stone in an awkward position. (Variation 2)
K	Um, Black can kick and cut White apart, right?
L	That’s also true, sure, since Black has more stones in the vicinity. I was talking about the standard case, in which Black wouldn’t have the Kobayashi stones! I could be wrong, but Lee Sedol 9p played the two-space low pincer a while ago. Somehow that move has appeared in this game.
S	Wow, that was deep.]

L	Exactly. If White plays at Move 8, as in the game, Black might consider the two-space high pincer. One of the more popular joseki’s created by AlphaGo looks something like this: White takes the corner, and Black accumulates outside influence. Personally, I think Black can be happy with this combination. (Variation 1)
S	Black’s bottom right seems very thick. However, isn’t it true that if Black saves the exchanges at 11 and 13, he would preserve more aji in White’s corner?
K	What you are saying is normally true; however, since Black has played Kobayashi, he’s more concerned about developing the bottom side. Therefore, I think Black can accept this outcome.]
